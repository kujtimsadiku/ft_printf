# ft_printf

## Making my own printf.

I at school as one of our project was to create a copy of printf. 

printf project was included to AI & algo bbranch, but even if you didn't decide to go algo branch it was still a beneficial.

## Bugs

My ft_printf is ready to go, but it has some bugs that i need to fix so that they  work. 

## How to use

To start using you need to clone the repo git clone {ssh-key} or you can download it as a zip file. After that you go the the root of the ft_printf folder and run this command 'make' and you will get a ftprintf.a file that you can include it to use the ft_printf function.
