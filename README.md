# ft_printf

## Making my own printf.

At school as one of our project was to create a copy of printf. 

printf project was included to AI & algo branch, but even if you didn't decide to go algo branch it was still a beneficial to do it for future use and the great way to learn how does the code run inside (understand and read code better).

## Bugs

My ft_printf is ready to go, but it has some bugs that I need to fix.
If you notice a bug I would appreciate if you would leave a comment int 'issue' section or you also leave a feedback (what would have been better).

## How to use

To start using you need to clone the repo git 'clone <ssh-key>' or you can download it as a zip file. After that you go the the root of the ft_printf folder and run this command 'make' and you will get a ftprintf.a library file that you can include in your header file or into your main file and you can start to use the ft_printf function.
